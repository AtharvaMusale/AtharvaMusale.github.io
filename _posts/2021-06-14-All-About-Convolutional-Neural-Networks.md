# **Introduction**-
From the emerge of [**ImageNet**](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) competition **Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)** have been the most favourite model for any Computer Vision experts. With its simplicity and brilliant frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch, it has become very easy to create a complex CNN architecture and implement it in tasks like Image Classification, Image Segmentation, Object Detection. In this blog I will try to explain CNNs in depth. This blog is going to be a bit long as there is lot to cover. So lets dive in!!!

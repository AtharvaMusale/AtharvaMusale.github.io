Hi Everyone! I am Atharva! I am a Machine Learning Engineer. I'm super excited to share what I'm learning here through this blog.

![Atharva](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46114095/135372725-014f4bb2-bfad-4484-a464-efd230428678.jpeg)

I am writing this blog to write about what I am learning in my own words. Mainly to reinforce what I'm learning (you don't really know something unless you can teach it!) this is an integral step of [Feynmann Technique](https://www.tradebrains.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-feynman-technique-safal-niveshak.jpeg). 

I am choosing to publish this blog publicly with the hope that it could help someone and most importatnly someone will read this and finds the mistakes and I can correct it. So don't take my blog as a absolute source of information. If you dont get anything please let me know and we can have a discussion. You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharva-musale/). You can check my previous blogs on [Medium](https://atharvamusale.medium.com/) as well.
. I hope this helps you all to get some insights in AI by reading this blog. Thanks you!

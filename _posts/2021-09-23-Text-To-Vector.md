Any Machine Learning or Deep Learning model operates on a numeric feature space, expecting an input to be a two-dimensional vector where rows are the instances and columns are the features. In order to perform a language modeling on text, text must be transformed into vector representation such that machine learning or deep learning algorithms can be applied to the textual data. This process of converting text to a vector is called Vectorization. This is the first essential step towards language modeling.

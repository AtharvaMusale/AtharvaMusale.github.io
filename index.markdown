- [Vision Transformer](https://atharvamusale.github.io/2021/06/06/Vision-Transformers.html) - Vision Transformers are setting new benchmarks in computer vision, showing that models trained on large datasets can outperform traditional CNNs. 
- [Probability And Statistics For Machine Learning](https://atharvamusale.github.io/2021/06/10/Probability-and-Statistics-For-Machine-Learning.html) - Understanding probability is crucial in machine learning as it aids in handling uncertainty with incomplete data. This blog explores the foundational role of probability in various machine learning scenarios, from classification models predicting class membership probabilities to algorithms making decisions based on probabilistic measures like information gain and Brier score. We delve into essential concepts such as population vs. sample, Gaussian distribution, skewness, kurtosis, and kernel density estimation, illustrating how mastering probability can significantly enhance the depth of understanding in machine learning models.
- [Representing text to vector](https://atharvamusale.github.io/2021/09/23/Representing-Text-To-Vector.html) - Explores the essential process of converting text into numerical vectors to facilitate machine learning and deep learning models, a technique known as vectorization. We delve into the most prevalent text vectorization methods including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe. Each technique's fundamental mechanics, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed, highlighting how methods like Word2Vec and GloVe not only capture the frequency of word occurrences but also consider the semantic relationships between words, significantly enhancing the model's ability to understand and process language data effectively. This exploration underscores the importance of these techniques in building robust language models that can interpret the nuanced meanings of words within various contexts.

Hi Everyone! Its Atharva, a Machine Learning enthusiast. I'm super excited to share what I'm learning here through this blog.

![Atharva](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46114095/135372725-014f4bb2-bfad-4484-a464-efd230428678.jpeg)

The main objective of writing these blogs is to reinforce what I'm learning ("you don't really know something unless you can teach it!"). This is an integral step of [Feynmann Technique](https://www.tradebrains.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/the-feynman-technique-safal-niveshak.jpeg). 

I am choosing to publish this blog publicly with the hope that it could help someone and most importantly someone will read this and find the mistakes I am amking and I can correct it. So don't take my blog as an absolute source of information. If you don't get anything please feel free to reach out to me and we can have a discussion. You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharva-musale/). You can check my previous blogs on [Medium](https://atharvamusale.medium.com/) as well. I hope this helps you all to get some insights in AI by reading this blog. Thank you!

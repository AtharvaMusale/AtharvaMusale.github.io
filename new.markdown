Hey everyone, This is Atharva ðŸ‘‹. I like to work on challenging Machine Learning/ Deep Learning problems. My journey till now in AI has been quite fascinating. Just to name a few, I once used my test data for training, trained a large network using CPU and blamed my the datset size for it(Data was CIFAR and Colab runtime GPU option was disabled) and list goes on and on. After making tons and tons of mistakes now I am in search of making some new mistakes and I hope to do the same by writing these blogs and showing the world how dumb a guy can be!!!.. Anyways if you find my blogs interesting, please go to psychiatrist ðŸ˜Š. JK Thanks a lot for reading my blogs. You can check my previous blogs on [Medium](https://atharvamusale.medium.com/) as well.

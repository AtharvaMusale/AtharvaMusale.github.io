<!-- # **Introduction**-
From the emerge of ImageNet competition for Image Recognition Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) have been the most favourite model for any Computer Vision experts. With its simplicity and brilliant frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch, it has become very easy to create a complex CNN architecture and implement it in tasks like Image Classification, Image Segmentation, Object Detection.  -->

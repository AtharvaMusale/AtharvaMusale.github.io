# **A Quick Review of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms** - 

In this blog I will try to write a overall of different machine learning algorithms. The very vague catagories of the machine learning algorithms are 
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning 
4. Reinforcement Learning

We will dive in each of these types of machine learning algorithms one by one starting with Supervised Learning. There are few common algoriths which are widely used in machine learning domain
